The Orthodox Bookmark Manager is a bookmark manager for Chrome bookmarks. Most of its
features are borrowed from Midnight Commander.

The screen of the Orthodox Bookmark Manager is divided into four parts. Almost all of
the screen space is taken up by two bookmark panels. The bottom line shows the
function key labels. The topmost line is the menu bar line.

The Orthodox Bookmark Manager provides two views of your Chrome bookmarks at the same
time. One of the panels is the current panel (<span class="selected">a teal selection bar</span> will signal
which panel is active), almost all operations take place on the current panel.
Some bookmarks operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of
the unselected panel as a destination.

One of the differences with Midnight Commander is that copying and moving book
marks is instantaneous, there is no opportunity to rename the bookmark

This is a list of the keys that work in Orthodox Bookmark Manager :

Down : move selection bar one spot lower

WARNING: there is no undo, with great powers comes great sorrow.
